## 📖 How It Works

1. The user types a **city name** into the input box.  
2. The user clicks the **search button** or presses **Enter**.  
3. JavaScript sends a **request to the OpenWeatherMap API** using the city name and API key.  
4. The API returns weather data in **JSON format**, including:
   - Temperature
   - Weather condition
   - Humidity
   - Wind speed  
5. The app displays this data in the UI:
   - Temperature and description in the center  
   - Humidity and wind speed in the details section  
   - A weather image changes dynamically based on the weather condition (Clouds, Clear, Rain, Mist, Snow)  
6. If the city is not found, a **“Location not found”** message with a 404 image is shown.
